Exchange Rate Converter:
This project will take correct data of exchange rate from an Exchange Rate API, and helps user exchange the currencies they enter.

Here’s the functions:
Currency Conversion: User can input the number they want to convert and select the source and target currencies from a dropdown menu.
Realtime Exchange Rates: The application fetches the latest exchange rates from the Exchange Rate API, to make sure accuracy and reliability.
Dynamic Conversion: When user input the number and select currencies, the application dynamically calculates and displays the converted amount.
Error Handling: The application includes error handling to notify users in case of invalid input or if the API request fails.

External Data Source:
The Exchange Rate Converter consumes data from a public Exchange Rate API, such as ExchangeRate-API, which provides real-time exchange rates for various currency pairs. 
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create the user interface and handle user interactions.
Backend: The application will primarily rely on frontend JavaScript to fetch data from the Exchange Rate API and perform currency conversions.
DOM Manipulation: JavaScript will work with the DOM to update the webpage with the fetched exchange rates and display the converted amounts.
Error Handling: Conditional branching will be used to handle errors, providing feedback to the user in case of invalid input or API request failures.
